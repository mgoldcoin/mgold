# How to receive and send Bitcoin Cash

Waves allow you to hold and transfer Bitcoin Cash on its blockchain. This works through a so-called Multigateway approach: Bitcoins Cash are sent to a user's deposit address available in the Waves wallet and after the deposit the user receives a Bitcoin Cash token \(wBCH\) on the Waves blockchain. Every single Bitcoin Cash token is backed 1:1 with a real Bitcoin Cash.
