# Issue Your Asset

Issuing your own token on Waves couldn’t be simpler, in the Wave client there is a tab for “Token Creation” where you can give your token a name and description, choose the total token and decimals and then create it. It costs just 1 Waves to do so and then your token can be traded on the DEX. 

Go to the **Tokens Creation** tab to create an asset, Figure 1.

**Important.** Before creating a new asset, please make sure that you have at least 1 WAVES on your account to pay the fee charged for the asset creation.

Then you need to fill the details of your Token, Figure 2:

1. **Name:** Enter the name of the asset in Latin in this field. The length of the asset name cannot be less than four characters. 
   Important to know here is that names are not unique to prevent name squatting but the identifier, also called asset ID, is unique. Whenever you are looking for a token, search and confirm it is the right one by checking the asset ID.
2. **Description:** A brief description of your project with a core message. You are also able to include website links which are particularly useful considering the asset description as of now is unchangeable.
3. **Total Tokens:** Maximum number of tokens. The total supply can either be fixed at issuance or increased later by making the asset re-issuable
4. **Re-Issuability:** It defines if an asset issuer can increase the token's supply at a later point or not. If set to **"Reissuable"**, the issuer can increase the supply at any time. It's also important to know that if **"Reissuable"** is set at the beginning, it can still be changed to **"Not reissuable"** at a later stage.
5. **Total Decimals:** In this section you can set how many decimals your asset shall have. For example, if you set 8 decimals as in Bitcoin, your token can be divided down to 0.00000001. If you set 0, your token can only be transacted in whole pieces.

After you have filled out all fields of the table, make sure they are filled out correctly. Press **"Generate"** if all fields are correct.

**Important.** The Waves network confirmation is required to create your asset. Currently, confirmation takes about one minute. You can see the asset status on the homepage of the Waves account in the "TRANSACTIONS" section.
