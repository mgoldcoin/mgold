# How to create a Token

Issuing your own token on Waves couldn’t be simpler, in the Waves client there is a tab for “Token Creation” where you can give your token a name and description, choose the total token and decimals and then create it.

It costs just 1 Waves to do so and then your token can be traded on the DEX.

Go to the **Tokens Creation** tab to create an asset ![](/_assets/token_creation_01.png)

**Note**: Before creating a new asset, please make sure that you have at least 1 WAVES on your account to pay the fee charged for the asset creation.

You'll see the following window:

Let's describe each boxes:

**Name of your asset**: First of all, give your token a name. Important to know here is that names are not unique to prevent name squatting but the identifier, also called asset ID, is unique. Whenever you are looking for a token, search and confirm it is the right one by checking the asset ID;

**Description**: Write a description for your token. You are also able to include website links which is particularly useful considering the asset description as of now is unchangeable;

**Total tokens**: Define the total supply of your token. The total supply can either be fixed at issuance or increased later by making the asset re-issuable;

**Reissuable**: Re-issuable defines if an asset issuer can increase the token's supply at a later point or not. If set to "Reissuable", the issuer can increase the supply any time. It's also important to know that if re-issuable is set to true at the beginning, it can still be changed to false at a later stage;

**Decimals**: Set how many decimals your asset shall have. For example, if you set 8 decimals as in Bitcoin, your token can be divided down to 0.00000001. If you set 0, your token can only be transacted in whole pieces (1, 3, 15);

**Note**: Before creating a new Asset, make sure that you have at least 1 WAVES for asset creation fee.

**Note**: The name of the created asset can not be shorter than 4 characters.

Check all the fields in the **Preview** box and if everything is OK, click on the **Generate** button.
