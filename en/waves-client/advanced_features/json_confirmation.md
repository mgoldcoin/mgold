# ​How to create JSON confirmation

As you may know, Waves app contains advanced functionality. One of them is [Script transaction](/waves-client/advanced_features/script_transaction.md). With this feature, you can create a multi-signature wallet. So, several owners of one Waves account can manage the funds stored on the same balance. For easier management of script transactions, we integrated a special section called **JSON**.

**Note**:The fee for a transfer of a Smart Asset from a Smart Account would be 0.001+0.004+0.004=**0.009 Waves**.
Set Alias for an account without a script would cost **0.001 WAVES**, whereas for a Smart Account it would be 0.001+0.004=**0.005 WAVES**.

**Before you start, please keep in mind. We do not recommend you submit JSON unless you are an experienced user. Errors may lead to loss of funds**.

So, to start using all available features of the application, first you need to activate the advanced features.

By the way, you can use either online version of the client, or standalone version for Mac, PC or Linux. All versions support automatic update!
