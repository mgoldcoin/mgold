# How to distribute a Token using Mass Transfer

You can make mass transfers right from your Waves wallet.
With this feature, you can distribute your Token, Waves or any other Waves based tokens on your balance directly to multiple (up-to 100) Waves addresses with several most natural actions.

Let's make distribution for Waves tokens, although this method also works for any other tokens of your balance. Before you start, please make sure that you have enough Waves for the transaction fee.

Open up your wallet.

Go to Portfolio, click on the **Send** button (top left corner).
